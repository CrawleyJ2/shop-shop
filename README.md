  ## Description

  Shop-Shop is a React App built for an e-commerce site. The site uses Stripe to handle payment processing, and allows users to add, edit, delete items from their cart. This codebase has been refactored to use Redux for managing state. For more information on what that means, or to see Redux for yourself, click [here](https://redux.js.org/).
